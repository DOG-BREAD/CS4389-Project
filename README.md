Python requirements - Python 3.11 or newer
There are no operating system requirements. We designed the program purely in Python to avoid this issue.

We recommend creating a virtual environment and utilizing our requirements.txt 

For help please check **here**
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Please launch the **GUI**

```python gui/mainGui.py```

The GUI will run all required functionality.
